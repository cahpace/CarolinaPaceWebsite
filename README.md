# CarolinaPaceWebsite
This is the first version of my web site. This first version was made with pure Javascript, with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Some parts I wanted to do without any library or framework help, so I could learn the bases. The most important part of coding this site was learning how to solve the problems and overcome challenges. This is not the final versions, just the initial version. Stay tuned for the next version, spoiler alert, it will be made with React!
